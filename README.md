# Data-Visalisation-UK-Populations
This Code uses the "Processing" application in order to show a visal representation of UK City populations over te years. It is coded in java and 
allows users to see a 3D visualisation of a UK map with bars to show population size. There is a key on the application its-self however everything 
is controlled through keyboard and mouse input.
